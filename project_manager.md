## Notes from past weeks (by Mirakel) ##

### Week 11 ###
Monday: Creating VLANS ("First VLAN" and "Second VLAN") and L3 connection (?)
Tuesday: Fixing mistakes from previous day, setting up 2 VRs
         (red VR, and blue VR) and creating logical tunnels (lt0 interfaces, only on SRX!)

Lt0 configuration is almost done, virtual routers in SRX are not able to ping each other.
